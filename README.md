# Fraud detection on an E-commerce website

Fraud detection is a set of activities to prevent money being stolen over the internet. E-commerce websites being the go-to method for making purchases for most people, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of frauds happening.

However, fraudulent transactions generally appear to be normal transactions of customers buying goods from a certain e-commerce website. Moreover, these transaction are much less likely to occur, given the huge number of total transactions occuring in the minute. Therefore, fraud detection has become a subject of interest for many researchers to automate the process using Machines, ie Machine Learning.

This repository contains the notebook named "Fraud Detection - Analysis & modelling" which uses exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify which features impact the most the fraud status of a customer. It also provides a machine learning model to predict if a customer is fraudulent or not based on the charateristics of the customer and their previous orders.
